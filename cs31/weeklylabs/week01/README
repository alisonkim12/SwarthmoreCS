In this directory:

   firstprog.c : an example C program with variable declaration, C 
                constants, and example calls to printf function.
                There are a lot of comments in this file explaining
                parts of the program

   functions.c: an example program with a function (includes function
                prototype, function call, fuction definition)
                NOTE: the complete function comment with its definition
                There are some TODO comments for some things you can
                try adding to this program and test out.

========================================
To compile a C program to an executable:

 gcc firstprog.c

If the program can successfully be compiled, gcc creates an executable 
file named a.out that you can run from the shell prompt:

 ./a.out

There are command line options to gcc, we will almost always use these two:

  -o filename    # put executable in a file named filename instead of a.out
  -g             # add debugging information to the executable file

Using these command line options:

  gcc -g -o firstprog firstprog.c

  ./firstprog

We are also going to use make to build programs.
make is a utility that uses commands from a Makefile
to build a program executable.  With a makefile, you can
just type make to compile both programs:

  make

Then run each:

  ./firstprog
  ./functions

To get rid of files created by compilation:

  make clean
