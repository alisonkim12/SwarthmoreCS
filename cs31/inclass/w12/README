To list CPU information on this machine:

  cat /proc/cpuinfo
  or lscpu


To see running threads:

  ps -eLf

To compile pthread programs, you need to explicitly link in the
pthreads library:

  gcc -g -Wall -o prog prog.c -lpthread

(the Makefile has a rule to do this for compiling hello)
----------------------------------------

We are going to look at hello.c pthread

  (1) try running it a few times with different numbers of threads

  (2) what is happening?

  (3) let's fix the race condition

  (4) let's time the code before and after fixing the race condition

      time ./hello  100
